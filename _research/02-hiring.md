abstract : "Resume studies have found that certain demographic or social groups have lower callback rates for job interviews than others. We show theoretically that such a form of hiring discrimination implies a higher volatility of labor market outcomes for the discriminated group in the context of a standard search-and-matching model with an urn-ball matching function. In line with this prediction, CPS data shows that blacks in the US have higher unemployment volatility over the business cycle compared to whites when controlling for many observables visible to employers. We do not find the same effect for women when compared to men, consistent with the fact that resume studies generally find hiring discrimination for women to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than for blacks. Quantitatively, our theoretic setup allows us to directly use the point estimates from resume studies as parameter inputs for the differential in hiring rates in our model. Doing so, and calibrating to the US labor market, we find that the model can explain 70% of the extra business cycle volatility in the black unemployment rate."
