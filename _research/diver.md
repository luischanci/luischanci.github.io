## Export diversification dynamics in Latin America


In this chapter, we construct a set of export diversification measures in order to give a detailed view of export diversification dynamics in Latin America. We use the available information contained in the COMTRADE database from the United Nations, covering the period between 1990 and 2012. We analyze export performance in terms of the intensive and extensive margins. This is done in two ways. First, we compute export concentration/ diversification indexes for each country and year over the twenty two year period. In addition, following Cadot et al. (2011), we use the Theil index, which can be broken down into two components, the between- and within-group variation. These give an idea of the isolated effect of the number of active export lines (Extensive Margin of Diversification – EMD) and the growth of export volumes holding the number of product lines constant (Intensive Margin of Diversification – IMD). Furthermore, we identify the total number of markets and the fraction of exports going to the ten main destinations of each country.

Second, following Brenton and Newfarmer (2007), Amiti and Freud (2010), Besedes and Prusa (2011), and Berthelon (2011), we decompose the export growth rates into two different margins. The first measures the growth that can be attributed to increases in the volume of exports in products at advanced phases of the export cycle (Intensive Margin of Export Growth – IMEG). The second margin is the discovery channel, which consists of the participation of new export lines in the growth of exports (Extensive Margin of Export Growth – EMEG).

Based on data for fifteen countries, between 1990 and 2012, Latin American exports grew in value terms at the annual rate of over 8 percent. Diversification also increased over the last two decades, with Brazil, Argentina and Mexico being the most diversified countries in the region. However, taking the most recent years into consideration, there has been decreased diversification in the region, mainly due to commodity price increases in real terms.

In terms of goods, using the Theil index, the main trait of concentration/diversification has been the rise of exports at the intensive margin, especially for countries like Venezuela, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia and Paraguay. However, although diversification in terms of the number of markets has increased (growing from 117 in 1990 to 155 in 2012), only ten markets account for more than 70 percent of total exports. A similar result is obtained when reviewing the number of active groups or active lines at three digits of aggregation, which has increased from 204 in 1990 to 242 in 2012, but only ten of these active lines account for more than 60 percent of the total exports.
