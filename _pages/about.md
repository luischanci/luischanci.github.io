I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at the State University of New York at Binghamton. I also hold an appointment as professor of economics at U.S.T.-Chile. My research interests are in applied econometrics, macroeconomics, and IO. At the moment I am teaching Introduction to Econometrics and working on my thesis.

In this website you can find my [CV](/CV), some information related to [teaching](/teaching/), [research](/research/), and other [resources](/resources/), such as econometric packages.
