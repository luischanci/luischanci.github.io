(Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.)

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    layout: page
    title: Project
    description: a project with a background image
    img: /assets/images/12.jpg
    ---


<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
    Caption photos easily.
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.  *bled* for your project.

The code is simple.
